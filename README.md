# Columnar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This project implements the Columnar Transposition Cipher technique in C#. The Columnar cipher is a classical encryption technique that rearranges the characters of the plaintext using a key (a list of numbers). The project includes encryption, decryption, and analysis functionality.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

- **Columnar Transposition Cipher:** A classical encryption technique that reorders characters in a grid based on a keyword (or key).
- **Encryption:** The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a specific key.
- **Decryption:** The reverse process of turning ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same key.
- **Analysis:** The process of finding the key used for encryption by analyzing the relationship between the ciphertext and the plaintext.
